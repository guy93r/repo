Docker Exam
===========

General
-------
Project Gutenberg is a public store of books that are in public domain.
The application you are about to dockerize, "gutindex", builds a searchable
index of all the books in Project guttenberg and allows users to search by
book name, author etc.

Gutindex uses:
(1) python & django to create the index and serve the files
(2) postgres to store and manage the index
(3) static html to make a lovely UI for people that want to try the API

The task
--------
(1) Copy the source code from 'project' folder

This is actually a fork from https://github.com/garethbjohnson/gutendex. 
Reading the documents is nicer in Github, so I recommend you use it BUT our copy
is _easier_ to dockerize - so DO NOT try to dockerize to one in github!

(2) Dockerize gutindex
Take into account that you need to handle all installation aspects: the app, the schema, the data upload on initialization, etc.

Gutindex installation guide is located at https://github.com/garethbjohnson/gutendex/wiki/Installation-Guide

(3) Create Docker compose of the following topology:
- Postgres db
- Gutindex backend
- NginX serving the static files and acting as a reverse proxy

- Once the system is set up, you should be able to find out how many Arthur Conan Doyle books are found in the database by curling "/books/?search=arthur%20conan%20doyle" {The right answer is 14} 

Important:
----------
(1) Gutindex docker image must not contain the static files
(2) Database should be persisted between restarting of containers
(3) Starting a system from scratch (empty volumes) must be stable, regardless of the order in which containers start being functional
(4) Concentrate on making things work first. Optimize later. 

Good Luck!
